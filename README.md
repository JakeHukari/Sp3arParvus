# Sp3arParvus - Universal Aim Client and other developer tools

Sp3arParvus provides the user a powerful ingame menu which enables esp, player tracking, and movement/physics prediction for combat as well as assistive tools like wallbreak, fullbright, preformance monitoring, and others.

**A lot of the aim stuff is based off [Parvus Hub](https://github.com/AlexR32/Parvus) from AlexR32**

### Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeHukari/Sp3arParvus/refs/heads/main/Sp3arParvus_v2.lua", true))() 
```

This script works universally on any roblox game that uses regular player models.

### Current Features

> SilentAim.

> TriggerBot.

> Player-ESP.

> Free-cam. (Ctrl + P)

> Waypoint System. (Ctrl + Middle-Mouse-Button)

> Br3ak3r. (Wallbreak) (Ctrl + Left-Click to break)(Ctrl + Z to undo break)

> Fullbright.

> Preformance Stats.

> Other stuff.

### Upcoming Features

> 'Any Item ESP' native integration. ([AIE](https://github.com/JakeHukari/Any-Item-ESP) is another script of mine that provides a workspace explorer to create esp highlights for any item or folder, this will soon be natively integrated into Sp3arParvus)

> Extended 'fullbright' customization. (Time, sky hue, reflections, colors, etc..(basically just customization for any 'light' or sky))

> Extended workspace explorer. (dex)

> Block 'placing' tool. (probably will function like wallbreak except placing a local object that you can walk on or climb up or something idk, obviously will only work locally)
