# Sp3arParvus - Universal Aim Client and other developer tools

Sp3arParvus provides the user a powerful ingame menu which enables esp, player tracking, and movement/physics prediction for combat as well as assistive tools like wallbreak, fullbright, preformance monitoring, and others.


### Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeHukari/Sp3arParvus/refs/heads/main/Sp3arParvus_v2.lua", true))() 
```

This script works universally on any roblox game that uses regular player models.

**A lot of the aim stuff is based off [Parvus Hub](https://github.com/AlexR32/Parvus) from AlexR32**
